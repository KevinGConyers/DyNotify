This is the code test submission for DyNotify. It is a simple web scraper that
scrapes amazon.com for the search terms provided to it. This is a minimum viable
program, as it is just a code test. It takes a search term in as a command line
argument, and saves the resulting JSON in a file, named results.json.


## Usage
To uses, simply run main.py in a terminal providing a search query as such. "'"
must be escaped on bash shell.
```bash
./main.py men\'s sunglasses
```
No need to use quotes, all words in query are assumed to be part of one query.



## Billing
As I stated in my delivery, I expect to be compensated for my time.
